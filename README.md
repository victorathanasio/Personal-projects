# Personal projects

This repository contains some of my personal projects since I started coding (2018), some of these projects dates from the very beginning of code for me, hope you enjoy.

Any doubts feel free to contact me at victor.athanasio@student-cs.fr

The projects in this repository are listed below (somewhat in order of usefulness and implementability) alongside a short description and motivation for each project.

1. Thermodinamics
2. ABRe
3. Coding Weeks
    - Flappy-bird
    - 2048
4. Numerical methods
5. MNIST
6. Bots
7. Febrace



## Themodinamics

This project was motivated by the need to access giant tables and make several by hand. The main objective was to know the value of multiple variables (such as entropy, enthalpy, etc.) for a given material and a given state (i.e. water vapor at 150 bars and 150 celsius).

With some clever algorithms, this program was able to reverse-engineer the states (i.e. given any other 2 properties, it was able to precisely define the state).

Very useful for analyzing thermodynamics cycles.

## ABRe

During my scientific initiation, I was tasked with a SBR (Systematic Bibliographic Review), which involved organizing more than 1000 articles in excel spreadsheets. This program is a web scrapper that I built to automate this part and allow for some "big data" analysis.

## Numerical methods

Implements a diverse gamma of numerical methods. The main idea was to be able to allow high performance in matrix manipulation without numpy.linalg. It was a great opportunity no only to use numba and as well to discover how to use GPUs for computing and study FORTRAN's implementation for efficient matrix calculus.

## MNIST

It was the first time that I played with neural networks and CNNs. Nothing too special, but good knowledge acquired

## Bots
A wide range of bots made to a diverse gamma of automation.

- Create a database of instagram users
- Comment on instragrans posts
- Check if the website of the french consulate had changed
- Autofill google forms
- Automatically access a game site to collect prizes

## Febrace

Basic web site to show the juniors enterprise portfolio in on the biggest science fairs in latin america (FEBRACE)
